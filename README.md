This is the first repo of Full Stack Journalists, a group of students and
professionals formed at Boston University on February 20, 2018.

Our goals as a group are:

* To make sure every member has a working development environment, and the basic skills to navigate it
* To build our own skills in the areas where code and journalism intersect
* To work on projects together
* To collaborate with newsrooms on data and code-driven projects.

If you would like to join, we hold introductory meetings once a month
which are held at the College of Communications at Boston University,
640 Commonwealth Avenue.

Our upcoming intro meetings are:

* 3/20/2018 5:30 PM
* 4/21/2018 5:30 PM

If you'd like to come, please let us know by [filling out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfhC6QR9eTbg1G0t2K-DJDVaB5XS2i4PAMpmhyzcZWhq-QbYA/viewform?usp=sf_link),
so we can contact you and let you know where we will be meeting (our meeting
rooms do change from month to month).

If you came to an introductory meeting and had difficulty installing
or using any of the basic tools, here's how to get help. We really want
you to get up and running! You can file an issue. [Here's how](https://github.com/fullstackjournalists/fullstackjournalists/blob/master/how-to-file-an-issue.md).
