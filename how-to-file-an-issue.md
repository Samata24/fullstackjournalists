# Full Stack Journalists Issue Tracker

This repository exists to support an issue queue for members of Full Stack
Journalists at Boston University. You can file an issue if you encounter
a problem setting up your development environment, getting the tools we use
working, or a project (though talk to your project leader to see
if they want to file project issues with the project repo.)

## What's an issue?

Examples:

* I'm trying to push a repository to Github from my machine but I'm getting an error message.
* We're using Tableau for a specific project, but I'm having a problem saving files.

## How do I file an issue?

You file your issues by visiting our [main repo](https://github.com/fullstackjournalists/fullstackjournalists/) and clicking on the [Issues tab](https://github.com/fullstackjournalists/fullstackjournalists/issues).

Once you [visit the Issues tab](https://github.com/fullstackjournalists/fullstackjournalists/issues) for our class repository, you click the button that says
"New Issue" and describe your issue.

### Read before you write your first issue

* Read: [How to file a good issue](https://upthemes.com/blog/2014/02/writing-useful-github-issues/)
* Search the issue queue. You can get extra credit points by filing great issues. You can also lose points by filing an issue that another team has already filed. Make sure to see if someone else has already filed the same issue.

*In every issue, you should include the following:*

* A description of what you were trying to do.
* The results you expected to get when you were trying to do it.
* The results that actually happened. Be sure to copy and paste any error messages!
* Anything you tried to fix the problem.
* What you Googled, and what you found out from Googling (I won't answer your issue until you can show me you tried to fix it, or find information about how to fix it, on your own).

### WARNING

Do not put usernames, passwords, or API keys in your issue! Issues are public and can be seen on the web by anybody.

### ONE ISSUE PER ISSUE

Each issue you file must contain only *one* problem you are trying to fix.

*Good: "When we changed our theme, videos disappeared"*

*Bad: "When we changed our theme, videos disappeared. We also want to pick a new plugin for maps"*

**Never put a list of unrelated problems in an issue.** An issue should tackle only ONE problem you are having. Got more than one issue? File more than one issue.

### Why write an issue? Why not just ask someone?

**Documenting Your Issues Helps You Solve Them Yourself**

When you write a solid issue -- in which you describe exactly what you did, what happened next,
what you tried to fix it, what you Googled, and the current state -- you'll often find that
during that process *you yourself* will figure out what went wrong and be able to fix it. If you do -- publish the issue anyway!

**Documenting Your Issue And How You Solved It Helps Others**

Not writing up your issue -- and documenting how you solved it -- means that your fellow students will not get the benefit of your experience.

**Documenting Your Issue and Then Filing It In Slack Gives You Good Habits**

If you really want technical co-workers to dislike you, walk up to their desk every time you have a problem and say, "Do you have a minute? I just need one small change." If you are going to work well with technical collaborators, you need to learn how to ask for help in a way that doesn't prevent them from getting work done. A constant stream of interruptions damages their ability to do their work. If you want their respect, write a solid, well-documented single issue, and submit it via the right channel.

**Documenting Your Issues and Using Slack Makes You Look Good To Potential Employers**

By using Slack and Github, you are also using tools that forward-thinking employers will see as
a valuable part of the skill package you can bring to their organization.

**Documenting Your Issues Means You Have A Github Account**

...which means you're one step closer to coding.

**IMPORTANT**

After you file your issue, paste a link to the URL of your issue in the #issues channel in our group Slack channel. Be sure to message @channel so we know you're looking for help. If you don't do these things, we won't see your issue and you won't get help right away.
